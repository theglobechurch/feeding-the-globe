## Method

- Cook rice. Chop vegetables.
- Cook lentils. Once lentils are mushy (important!), add creamed coconut and curry paste. Add vegetables and let it cook. Add chopped coriander.
- Mix natural yoghurt with a bit of mint sauce to make the raita.
- Serve rice and curry with raita and naan â€“ enjoy!

## Tips

- You can substitute the creamed coconut with double cream or butter
- Feel free to substitute the curry paste for any curry powder, but you might then need some sugar or salt
- Naan bread makes a great side
- This recipe is really flexible in terms of vegetables, so a good opportunity to use whatever you have in your fridge/freezer!
