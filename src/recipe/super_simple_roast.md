## Method

- Wash and chop the potatoes. Put them in the microwave for 3 minutes per portion (so for 2, 6 mins, etc). Put them in an oven tray together with the lamb chops and drizzle with oil. A very rough guideline is to cook them in the oven at 200C for 1h or at 160C for 80-90 mins. But that very much depends on your oven and how much is in it – just cook them until they are browned.
- Cook the green beans and sweetcorn. Prepare the stuffing and gravy (just add boiling water).
- And that’s it! Enjoy, and celebrate the resurrection of our Lord!
