## Method

- Mix taco spice mix. Cook rice.
- Meat option: fry meat and add taco spice mix. If using lentis: boil meat and when browned add lentis. When lentils are cooked (it takes time!), add taco spice mix.
- Veggie option: heat up beans, tomatoes, onion. Add taco spice mix.
- Prepare Pico de Gallo: marinate red onion in lime juice. Mix in tomatoes and coriander.
- Construct your burrito! Ideal situation = wrap + rice + meat/bean chilli + Pico de Gallo, cheese, yoghurt and tortilla chips.

## Tips

- Replace the burrito filling with refried beans by mashing any tinned bean (e.g. baked beans) with the taco spices
- Replace fresh tomato with tinned tomato or anything else tomato (puree or even ketchup)
- Replace lime juice with lemon juice
- Be spice-wise: cumin, garlic and salt are the most important spices. The other spices are awesome, but can be left out
- If you have no wraps, do a deconstructed burrito = literally a burrito but without the wrap
