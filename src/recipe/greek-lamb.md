- Dressing: balsamic vinegar, oil, and sugar in a 2:2:1 ratio

## Method

1. Cook the rice
2. Make the Tzatziki
3. Chop the salad
   - Don't overmix, or the feta will fall apart
4. Cook the meat and add the spice mix

## Tips

- Lots of Globe meals use a spoonful or two of mint sauce.
- To make it go further (and less expensive) you can add beef mince or lentils with a 1:2 ratio
- For the Greek Salad, you could substitute any salad with vegetables and feta with a dressing of 2:2:1 balsamic vinegar, oil, and sugar
- Step you your tzaki game by adding diced or grated cucumber
- Warm pittas make a great side to this meal
