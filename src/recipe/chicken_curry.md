## Method

- Cook rice
- Meat option: Boil chicken. Once cooked, add lentils. When lentils are mushy (important!), add creamed coconut and spice. Add vegetables and let it cook.
- Veggie option: Boil lentils. Once lentils are mushy (important!), add creamed coconut and spice. Add vegetables and let it cook.
- The trick is to add plenty of curry powder (1-2 tsp per person of mild spice). If you like it milder, use less but make up the flavour with a stock cube, ginger garlic or salt.
- Mix natural yoghurt with a bit of mint sauce to make the raita.
- Serve rice and curry with raita and naan (and mango salsa, see below) – enjoy!

## Tips

- Replace curry paste with curry sauce, powder or home-made spice mix (Asha’s suggestion: 1 tsp turmeric, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp chilli powder, 2 tsp garam masala powder for 1-2 portions of curry)
- If you have no lentils, puree any beans to thicken the sauce
- The vegetables can be frozen or fresh
- Replace creamed coconut with any sort of oil/fat
- Replace the mint sauce for the raita with crushed garlic, salt and mint
- To get different flavours, play around with your spice mix, and add onions, tomato puree or sugar.
- Make fresh mango salsa for a delicious accompaniment by blending mango, salt, lemon, ginger and onion
