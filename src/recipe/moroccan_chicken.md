## Method

- Mix spice mix. Chop up lemon very finely (remove seeds, chop up skin as well). Prepare couscous. Chop vegetables.
- Meat option: cook meat thoroughly. Add chick peas, beans, sweetcorn, carrots and stock. Add stock, spice mix, lemon (including skin) and apricot jam.
- Veggie option: cook sweet potato and onion. Add carrots, chick peas and stock. Add stock, spice mix, lemon (including skin) and apricot jam.
- Serve with couscous. If you have bread leftover, that’s great to serve with this as well to eat with the sauce.
- Best way to serve it is to serve it tagine style – with the vegetables beautifully arranged in a wheel (do Google for pictures)
- Enjoy!

## Tips

- Replace diced chicken with diced pork
- Replace apricot jam with dried apricots, or if that’s not possible you can use sugar
- Replace green beans, sweetcorn and carrots with frozen mixed vegetables
- Replace couscous (naturally contains gluten) for rice (naturally gluten free)
- General bit of advice: make sure to add enough stock. Dissolve stock in mug with boiling water before adding it to avoid unpleasant clots of stock in your final product
