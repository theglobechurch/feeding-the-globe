## Method

- Start with your rice and a generous amount of boiling water
- Add the ingredients for the meat or vegan options, excluding frozen veg
- To avoid burning or sticking bring the paella to a vigorous boil for 2 minutes, then cover and turn off the heat - the rice will continue to cook in the steam
- After 10 minutes add the stock dissolved in hot water and then the mixed vegetables.
- Add more water if necessary and then bring back to the boil.
- Serve when the vegetables are cooked.
