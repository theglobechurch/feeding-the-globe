## Tips

- Replace curry paste with curry sauce, powder or home-made spice mix
- Adding extra vegetables such as peppers is a good thing
- Substitute passata for chopped tomatoes (fresh or tinned), tomato puree or even ketchup
- Step up your game by adding a bit of mint sauce to your yoghurt to make raita
- If you’re making this for a larger group and are worried about the price, consider using a combination of beef and lamb mince and use lamb stock cubes to guarantee taste
