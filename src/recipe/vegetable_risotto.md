## Method

- Essential: sundried tomatoes + oil and olives + brine to ensure flavour and oil.
- Start with the oil from the sundried tomatoes. Use it to fry the leeks and garlic. Add the rice to coat it in oil. When the rice is glossy, add a generous amount of boiling water. Add the sundried tomatoes and olives + brine. Bring the risotto to a vigorous boil for 2 minutes, then cover it and turn off the heat. This way, the rice will continue to cook in the steam without burning or sticking.
- After 15 minutes, add the other vegetables. Check levels of hot water and add more if necessary. Bring it back to boil and then turn off again.
- Itâ€™s done when the vegetables are cooked and the rice is soft. Add salt, pepper and sugar if necessary.
- Serve your risotto with spinach on the side and crumble feta on top.
