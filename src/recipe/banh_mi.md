## Method

- Meat option: Pork shoulder is best because it’s fatty, but do trim off excess fat. Ideally you’d roast the pork, but you can also boil it in water and then drain it. It has to be cooked for at least three hours - it’s done when it falls apart easily. Once the pork is cooked, squeeze in hoisin sauce and add salt.
- Veggie option: Prepare beansprouts, carrots, onions and beans and dress in soy sauce. Add vegetable stock cube if necessary.
- Shred the carrot, cabbage and onion and mix it with mayonnaise, sriracha and kale.
- Enjoy the pulled pork in a roll with chilli slaw, close your eyes and imagine you’re at GlobeSpace surrounded by your church family!

## Tips

- Substitute pork with chicken
- Another great side is a herb salad: spinach, rocket, coriander and mint with a mango/lime juice dressing
