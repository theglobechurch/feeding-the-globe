## Method

- Ideally roast the pork, however slow cooking or boiled and drained works too. Cook for at least three hours
- For the veggie option; roast the root veg and dress with the BBQ sauce
- While the meat is cooking, shred the carrot, cabbage, and onion. Then mix in the mayonnaise
- Using a pair of forks, pull the meat apart
- Squeeze in BBQ sauce and salt- the key is to balance the sweet of the BBQ sauce with the salt and fat of the pork
- Serve the pulled pork in a bread roll with the coleslaw on the side

## Tips

- Serve with fresh cooked bread, or bakery bread
- The pork can be substituted for chicken
- For a twist to the coleslaw, add either coriander and chilli
